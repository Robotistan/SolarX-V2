### Solar energy is one of the renewable energy sources because it is obtained from natural sources. Renewable energy sources are energy that can be obtained continuously from the energy flow that exists in natural processes. For example, since sunlight will continue as long as our world exists, solar energy obtained from sunlight is a renewable energy source.
