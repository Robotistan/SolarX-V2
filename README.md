# SolarX-V2
### Solar energy is one of the renewable energy sources because it is obtained from natural sources. Renewable energy sources are energy that can be obtained continuously from the energy flow that exists in natural processes. For example, since sunlight will continue as long as our world exists, solar energy obtained from sunlight is a renewable energy source.

## What is SolarX and How Does It Work? 
### SolarX is a STEM activity kit that includes 2 LDR modules (totally 4 LDR sensors), 2 servo motors, a solar panel and wooden parts. In addition, SolarX has a development board that uses the Arduino Nano processor. Thanks to this board, SolarX's circuit connections can be done easily.
